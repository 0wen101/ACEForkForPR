# ACE - Amiga C Engine

Game engine written totally in C for classic Amiga hardware. Lightweight, flexible and hackable. Coded mostly for bare HW, OS function usage is receeding. Nonetheless code is OS-friendly, allowing running from and exiting to Workbench gracefully.

Current feature set is OCS-oriented, although produced code should work on AGA just fine.

For build instructions basic how to and contributing guidelines, refer to [docs](docs/README.md).
